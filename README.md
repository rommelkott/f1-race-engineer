# AI Race Engineer
## Introduction
The goal of the project is to create an AI race engineer that can provide real-time feedback to a driver for the formula 1 racing game.

The idea is to read telemetry data from the game and create context for an AI model to provide feedback to the driver. This will enable the driver to ask questions to the engineer during the race and see the feedback in real-time.

The project has several challenges:
- Read telemetry data from the game
- Interpret the telemetry data to create context for the AI model
- Create or use an AI model that can provide feedback to the driver
- Personality of the AI model, etc.
- Voice recognition and synthesis

### I'm still new to programming so this is a learning opportunity for me. :) I'm open to any suggestions and feedback.
